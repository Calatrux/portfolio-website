This project is a personal portfolio website using Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The design should be sleek, modern, and highly responsive, with smooth animations and scroll-based interactions. Integrate with a Figma MCP server to import and use Figma designs. Code should be optimized for Copilot agent mode.
